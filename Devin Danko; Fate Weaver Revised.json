Some represent creatures, places, or objects and tell the stories of their journeys through reality, while others represent the bonds between those things. They intertwine and influence each other’s paths as time marches from future to present to past.",

Some are simply gifted from birth, some become connected to the threads through a profound act of magic, and some are granted knowledge through contact with a being of immense power.
