						"Fate Weavers can bend and warp the threads that bind all of reality together, granting them the power to change the destiny of themselves and everyone around them. These threads, the so-called {@i 'threads of fate'}, form the underlying structure of the multiverse. Some represent creatures, places, or objects and tell the stories of their journeys through reality, while others represent the bonds between those things. They intertwine and influence each other’s paths as time marches from future to present to past.",
						"The past is a tightly woven tapestry—an impossibly intricate ledger of {@i everything} that has ever happened. The future is a web of possibility—a forest of branching threads that represent every possible outcome simultaneously. The present is where a Fate Weaver does their work: tugging at the threads to favor branches that realize their desires and avoid those that spell doom.",
						"Fate Weavers are incredibly rare, and they can come about in many ways. Some are simply gifted from birth, some become connected to the threads through a profound act of magic, and others still are granted knowledge through contact with a being of immense power. Whatever their origin, most Fate Weavers find that dodging the call to adventure is futile. After all, it’s hard to avoid destiny when you’re the one pulling the strings."
