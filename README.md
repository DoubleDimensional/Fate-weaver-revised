A heavily revised version of Erikku Blade's Fate Weaver Class.

This homebrew includes:
## The Fateweaver class
- A CHA-based full caster that performs magic by manipulating the fundamental threads that make up reality itself.
- Heavily geared towards support/utility, with minimal offensive options.
- Like a wizard, cleric, druid, bard, and a sorcerer all had a baby. And the baby can see the structure of the universe.
- Bend fate in your party's favor and toward your enemy's doom.
- Manipulate your spell slots.
- Do cool fate magic stuff

## Four subclasses
- Loosely based on some of the cards in the Deck of Many Things.

#### The Vizier
*Peer into the Web of Fate*
- WIP
- Excel in divination
- Uplift your allies
- See the Future

#### The Void
*Know True Nothingness*
- WIP
- Circumvent effects (this shit aint nothing on me, man)
- Move unimpeded
- Unravel things

#### The Knight
*Class splash text WIP*
- Wield arms and armor
- Protect your allies
- Sever threads

#### Subclass 4 TBD
*splash text*
- cool stuff I'm sure

## A New Spell
#### Dewthorne's Defer Destiny
- Steal rolls and deploy them later like a div wizard's portent.
