A *heavily* revised version of Erikku Blade's Fate Weaver Class.

This homebrew includes:
## The Fateweaver class
- A CHA-based full caster that performs magic by manipulating the fundamental threads that make up reality itself.
- Heavily geared towards support/utility, with minimal offensive options.
- Like a wizard, cleric, druid, bard, and a sorcerer all had a baby. And the baby can see the structure of the universe.
- Bend fate in your party's favor and toward your enemy's doom.
- Manipulate your spell slots.
- Do other cool fate magic stuff

## Four subclasses
#### The Oracle
*Peer into the Web of Fate*
- Excel in divination
- Guide your allies
- See the future

#### The (Void? Fateless? Unbound? Untethered?)
*WIP*
- Circumvent effects (this shit aint nothing to me, man)
- Move unimpeded (telport and move through walls)
- Unravel things (destroy completely)

#### The Keeper
*WIP*
- Wield arms and armor
- Protect your allies
- Sever enemy's threads

#### Subclass 4 TBD
*WIP*
- Maybe something about being in a cycle, repeating the past, Déjà vu?
- Something about alternate realities, following branches that have been lost?

## A New Spell
#### Dewthorne's Defer Destiny
- Steal rolls and deploy them later like a div wizard's portent.
