A *heavily* revised version of Erikku Blade's Fate Weaver Class.
- Intended for use with the D&D 2024 rules, but it's mostly compatible with 2014. Some features assume the functionality of 2024 spells.
- Not guarenteed to be balanced at all. I did my best, but I have not playtested most of this.

This homebrew includes:
## The Fateweaver class
- A CHA-based full caster that performs magic by manipulating the fundamental threads that make up reality itself.
- Heavily geared towards support/utility, with minimal offensive options.
- Bend fate in your party's favor and toward your enemy's doom.
- Manipulate your spell slots.
- Do other cool fate magic stuff.

## Four subclasses
#### The Oracle
*Peer into the Web of Fate*
- Embraces the core class flavor
- Expert at divination magic
- Improves the base class's support options

#### The Void
*WIP*
- Subverts the core class flavor
- Circumvent effects.

#### The Phoenix
*WIP*
- Damage focused

#### The Keeper
*WIP*
- Defense focused
- Protect your allies

## An Item
#### Divination Focus
- Can be used as a spellcasting focus by Fate Weavers, and to perform minor divinations.

## A New Spell
#### Dewthorne's Defer Destiny
- Steal rolls and deploy them later like a div wizard's portent.
- It's probably super overpowered, ask your DM before using it.
